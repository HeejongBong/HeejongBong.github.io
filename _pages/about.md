Hello, nice to meet you! 

My name is Heejong Bong. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Purdue University. My research focuses on causal inference for data with complex dependence structures such as longitudinal and network data, a challenging and rapidly evolving area of statistics with broad applications in public health and the social sciences.

Beyond this core area, I have worked on diverse topics, including spatiotemporal methods, graphical models, causal inference for time-series data, high-dimensional central limit theorems, and ranking from pairwise comparisons. For more details on both current and past research, please see my [projects](/projects/) page.

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), advised by Professors Robert E. Kass and Valérie Ventura. My doctoral research developed statistical methods to decode communication between brain regions using high-dimensional neural recordings, introducing latent factor time-series models and matrix-variate graphical models.

Following my Ph.D., I spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher at CMU, collaborating with Professors Kass, Ventura, Larry Wasserman, Zhao Ren, Alessandro Rinaldo, and Arun Kuchibhotla on several theoretical and applied projects. I then continued as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan, working with Professors Elizaveta Levina, Ji Zhu, and Colin B. Fogarty on causal inference under network interference.
